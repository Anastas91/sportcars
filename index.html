    <h2>THE 
      UNFORGETTABLE: DISCOVER THE HISTORY OF THE RACING "BARCHETTA"
    </h2>
    <p>The Ferrari 166 MM “barchetta” was the cornerstone of a long line of open sports racing cars that came out of the Maranello factory through the fifties and into the early sixties. 
      It was first presented in September 1948 at the Turin Motor Show as a “spider da corsa”.

      TIMELESS STYLE
    </h3>
    <p><img src="img/ad20.jpg" alt="advantages" class="round">
      A car that seems sculpted by the wind. 
      It is the purity of the styling elements that impresses – an aesthetic that is futuristic but, at the same time, a respectful yet un-nostalgic homage to the past.
      The development of the design of the interior focused specifically on the driver cockpit.
      The instruments, instrument cluster and seat structure needed a functional rethink to meet the driver’s new requirements.
      The first level of the interior architecture is the driver’s visual horizon. 
      From that perspective, the line between the car’s interior and exterior is very subtle indeed. 
      The driver’s body is entirely encapsulated by the car apart from their head which juts out over the horizon line.

      The most powerful V12 ever to leave the gates of Maranello the most powerful V12.
      Amongst these is a 350 bar direct injection system for the very first time on a high-performance
      petrol engine paired with variable geometry intake tracts conceptually derived from of naturally-
      aspirated F1 engines. Particular attention was also paid to calibrating the performance strategies
      to enhance the engine's potential and the sensation of extreme power delivered by the car while ensuring the driver
      can easily dose the massive torque available, thanks to smooth,
      progressive power delivery at all engine speeds.

      Maximum comfort with the virtual wind shield. The result is that the model is perfectly balanced with no roll whatsoever for almost 
      unimaginably pure, uncompromising sports-car handling. 
      Because there are no windscreen pillars, the driver’s view is completely unhindered and this enables them to attack corners with a freedom 
      only experience with a Formula 1 car. The driver can thus enjoy involving and rewarding sports car responses over twisty routes: the car is always gratifying but never difficult to control.
